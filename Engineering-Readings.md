# Engineering Readings

These readings are important topics to read about for example the value of time, how to problem solving, how to think like programmer, and the 5 whys analysis
finally what I liked the most is ted talk "The Super Mario Effect" , for me it is a totaly new idea that I never heard about it befor the concept is to think about the learning prosess like it is a supermario game, so if you faced a dificulty or faler you will start over agin and you wouldnot  be frustrated because you are concntrated on resqing the princese not how amny timeies you re did the level.
overall that reading was a good motivation and thoughts organizing.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
Firstly, I will bring organizing and discipline because I am not only a hard worker but also a smart worker. As an architect I have a problem solving mind set and very good imagination that will help me to be the best in this career thats why I will be like the super emoployee.
    
### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
1- I will remember the super mario effect, I will take things easy and keep on learning by trial and error


2- I will do the 5 whys analysis, because in that matter it will help me to go back and see the first reason of the problem, thus i will be like seeing the problem again in fresh eye.


3- I will do this steps form "How to Solve Programming Problems" reading 
   - Read the problem completely twice.
   - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
   - Optimize the manual steps.
   - Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
   - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
   - Optimize the real code.
