# Introduction to SQL
This is an introduction to SQL, or Structured Query Language, which is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications. There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to understand what a relational database is. A relational database represents a collection of related two-dimensional tables, similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns and any number of rows of data. SQL is used to answer specific questions about this data, such as "What types of vehicles on the road have less than four wheels?" or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?"

SQLBolt is a series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help users quickly learn SQL right in their browser. The lessons introduce users to the various parts of an SQL query and later show how to alter a table or schema and create new tables from scratch. Each lesson ends with an interactive exercise. By the end, the goal is for users to have a strong foundation for using SQL in their own projects and beyond.
