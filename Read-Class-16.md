### What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that frees developers from the burden of managing servers. Instead of provisioning and configuring servers, developers can focus solely on writing code and deploying their applications. The cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including server management, scaling, and maintenance. This allows developers to iterate quickly and deploy changes faster, resulting in rapid development and deployment cycles. Furthermore, serverless computing offers automatic scaling, ensuring that applications can handle varying workloads without manual intervention. Developers only pay for the actual execution time and resources consumed during code execution, leading to cost optimization and efficiency.

Compared to traditional server-based architectures, serverless computing provides several advantages. It eliminates the need for upfront infrastructure planning and management, reducing operational overhead. It also offers cost efficiency by charging based on actual usage, allowing users to avoid paying for idle or underutilized servers. Additionally, serverless architectures are highly scalable and fault-tolerant, with automatic scaling and built-in redundancy. This ensures applications can handle sudden spikes in traffic or failure of individual resources, leading to improved scalability and availability. Overall, serverless computing empowers developers to focus on writing code and delivering value while abstracting away the complexities of server management and scaling.

How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

1. Sign up for a Vercel account and install the Vercel CLI.
2. Set up your project directory and ensure it has the necessary files and dependencies.
3. Create a directory for your serverless function and write the function code.
4. Configure your project by creating a `vercel.json` file in the root directory.
5. Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your project by running the command "vercel" in the project's root directory.
6. Test and monitor your deployed serverless function using the provided API endpoint URL and Vercel dashboard.

What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

1. Find the API: Identify the API that provides the desired data or functionality.
2. Choose the appropriate API type: Determine whether it is a RESTful API, SOAP API, or another type.
3. Obtain API credentials: If required, acquire the necessary API key or authentication credentials.
4. Install libraries: Install any required libraries or SDKs using pip.
5. Make API requests: Use the library or SDK to construct and send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
6. Handle API responses: Receive the API response, parse it using JSON or XML libraries, and extract the relevant data.
7. Process and utilize the data: Perform required data manipulation or analysis within your Python application.

What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library in Python simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. Here's a concise example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print('Request failed with status code', response.status_code)
```
