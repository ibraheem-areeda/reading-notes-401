# Linked lists
A linked list is a data structure used in computer science to store a sequence of elements. It consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Linked lists are often used in situations where the size of the data is not known in advance, or where elements need to be added or removed from the list frequently. They can be useful for implementing stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.

There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence. In a circular linked list, the last node in the list has a reference to the first node, creating a circular sequence.

Linked lists have some advantages over other data structures, such as arrays. For example, they can grow and shrink dynamically, and inserting or deleting an element in the middle of a linked list is faster than doing the same operation in an array. However, linked lists can be less efficient than arrays when it comes to accessing elements randomly, because the elements are not stored contiguously in memory.

# Analogy
An analogy for a linked list could be a chain of train cars. Just like a linked list, a train consists of a sequence of connected cars (nodes) where each car contains cargo (data) and a coupling device (pointer) that attaches to the next car in the train. Similarly, a linked list consists of a sequence of connected nodes where each node contains data and a pointer that links to the next node in the list.

Just as train cars can be added or removed from a train without affecting the rest of the train, elements can be added or removed from a linked list without affecting the rest of the list. However, just as it can be difficult to access a particular item in a train car without searching through the entire train, accessing a particular element in a linked list can be slower than in an array because it may require traversing the list from the beginning.

# walk through an example
let's walk through an example of a singly linked list.
Suppose we want to create a linked list to store the following sequence of integers: 5, 7, 3, 1, 9. We start by creating a node for the first element, 5. The node contains the value 5 and a pointer to the next node, which is initially set to NULL since there are no other nodes yet.

```

| 5 | -> | NULL |

```

Next, we create a new node for the second element, 7. This node contains the value 7 and a pointer to the next node, which is again set to NULL.

```

| 5 | -> |  7   | -> | NULL |

```

To add the third element, 3, we create another node and set the next pointer of the second node to point to the new node.

```

| 5 | -> |  7   | -> |  3   | -> | NULL |

```

We repeat this process for the remaining elements, adding a new node for each one and updating the next pointer of the previous node to point to the new node.

```

| 5 | -> |  7   | -> |  3   | -> |  1   | -> |  9   | -> | NULL |

```

Now we have a linked list containing the sequence of integers we wanted to store. To traverse the list, we start at the first node and follow the next pointers until we reach the end of the list. We can also add or remove elements from the list by adjusting the next pointers of the nodes.
