### What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) serve as a secure and efficient method for transmitting information between parties in web applications. The primary purpose of JWTs is to provide a stateless and self-contained means of authentication and authorization. When a user logs in or a client requests access, the server generates a JWT that includes relevant user data as claims in the payload. The token is then signed using a secret key and a cryptographic algorithm, ensuring its integrity during transmission. Subsequently, the client can include the JWT in future requests, and the server can validate its authenticity by recalculating the signature using the secret key. This approach eliminates the need for server-side session storage and allows for easier integration in distributed systems, contributing to enhanced scalability and security.


### How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?

JWT Authentication is seamlessly integrated with Django REST Framework (DRF) to secure API endpoints. After installing the necessary packages and configuring Django settings, authentication is enabled using DRF's TokenObtainPairView or TokenObtainSlidingView, generating JWTs upon successful login or client authentication. To secure endpoints, decorators like @authentication_classes and @permission_classes are applied in views or viewsets, restricting access to authenticated users with valid JWTs. DRF's JWT authentication mechanism automatically validates tokens during requests, ensuring integrity and expiration checks. Optionally, token refresh views can be employed to extend token lifespans without re-authentication. This seamless integration enhances API security, allowing only authorized users or clients to access protected resources.

### Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?

Django's built-in `runserver` is not suitable for production environments due to its limited performance, scalability, and lack of essential security features. It is a single-threaded development server designed for convenience during development, not for handling the demands of a live application. Production environments require servers that can efficiently handle multiple concurrent requests, distribute the load, and protect against security threats.

For deploying a Django application in production, alternative server options should be considered. Popular choices include Gunicorn and uWSGI, both of which are WSGI servers capable of serving multiple requests concurrently. Additionally, ASGI servers like Daphne and uvicorn are suitable for Django applications that utilize asynchronous features. It's also recommended to use Nginx or Apache as reverse proxies to handle static files, act as load balancers, and provide additional security features. Combining these server options with a well-optimized deployment setup ensures better performance, scalability, and security for production-level Django applications.
