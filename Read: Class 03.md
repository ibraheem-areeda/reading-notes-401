### What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?
The 'with' statement is a powerful tool in Python for managing resources. It can be used to manage any resource that needs to be released when it is no longer needed, such as files, database connections, or network sockets. By using the 'with' statement, the programmer can ensure that the resource is always released, even if an error occurs. This can help prevent issues like memory leaks, file corruption, or lost data.

When working with files, the 'with' statement is especially useful because it simplifies the process of opening and closing files. The programmer doesn't need to worry about manually closing the file or handling errors that might occur during file operations. Instead, they can focus on the logic of reading or writing data to the file, and let Python handle the resource management. This can make code more readable and easier to maintain, since the programmer doesn't need to add extra lines of code to handle resource management. Overall, the 'with' statement is a powerful tool for managing resources in Python, and can help prevent issues that might arise from not properly releasing resources.

### Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method?
the main difference between the 'read()' and 'readline()' methods for file objects in Python is the amount of data they read at once. The 'read()' method reads the entire contents of a file and returns it as a string, while the 'readline()' method reads a single line of a file at a time and returns it as a string. The choice of which method to use depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

The 'read()' method is typically used when the entire contents of a file need to be processed as a single string. This method is suitable for small files that can fit comfortably in memory, and can be less efficient for very large files that would require a lot of memory to store. On the other hand, the 'readline()' method is useful when processing large files line-by-line, or when the contents of a file need to be processed one line at a time. By reading and processing the file one line at a time, it is possible to conserve memory and avoid loading the entire file into memory at once.

### Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.

Exception handling is a mechanism in Python that allows for the detection, reporting, and recovery from errors that may occur during program execution. The 'try', 'except', and 'finally' blocks are used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code. The 'try' block contains the code that may raise an exception, while the 'except' block catches and handles the exception if it occurs. The 'finally' block is optional and is used for cleanup operations that should be performed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. An example of exception handling using these blocks is provided in the code snippet above.
